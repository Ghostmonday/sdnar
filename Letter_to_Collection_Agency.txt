RE: Dispute of Debt and Request to Cease Collection
    Reference #: 54085909
    Case Numbers: 22-TRS-049346, 22-TRS-014382, 21-NM-010724-A, 22-NF-004663-A
    Amount Claimed: $1,460.00

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing in response to your correspondence dated August 19, 2025, regarding the above-referenced debt. This letter serves as formal notice that:

1. I DISPUTE THIS DEBT in its entirety and request full validation and itemization of all charges.

2. I AM UNABLE TO PAY this debt due to my current financial circumstances.

FINANCIAL HARDSHIP DECLARATION

I am currently receiving the following government assistance, which demonstrates my inability to pay:

    • Cash Assistance (CalWORKs): [YES/NO - CONFIRM]
    • CalFresh (Food Stamps/SNAP): [YES/NO - CONFIRM]
    • Section 8 Housing Assistance: [YES/NO - CONFIRM]
    • Medi-Cal: [YES/NO - CONFIRM]
    • SSI/SSP: [YES/NO - CONFIRM]
    • Other: [SPECIFY IF ANY]

My current monthly income is: $[AMOUNT] 
My current monthly expenses exceed my income.

LEGAL BASIS FOR INABILITY TO PAY

Under California law, individuals receiving means-tested government benefits are presumed unable to pay court-ordered fines and fees. Specifically:

    • California Penal Code § 1237.2 requires courts to consider ability to pay
    • California Government Code § 68632 establishes presumptions of eligibility for fee waivers
    • Assembly Bill 1869 (2020) eliminated many criminal administrative fees retroactively

Additionally, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. § 1692g, requires you to cease collection activity until you have provided adequate validation of this debt.

REQUEST FOR ACTION

I hereby request that you:

1. Provide complete itemization of all fines, fees, and assessments comprising the $1,460.00 claimed
2. Identify which fees have been eliminated under AB 1869
3. Cease all collection activity while I pursue an ability-to-pay determination through San Mateo Superior Court
4. Confirm in writing that you will not report this debt to credit bureaus while disputed

ENCLOSED DOCUMENTATION

I have enclosed the following documents as proof of my financial status:

    [ ] Proof of CalWORKs/Cash Assistance
    [ ] Proof of CalFresh/SNAP Benefits  
    [ ] Section 8 Housing Voucher / Lease Agreement
    [ ] Proof of Medi-Cal Coverage
    [ ] Recent Bank Statements showing no/minimal income
    [ ] [OTHER DOCUMENTS - TO BE SPECIFIED]

Please respond to this dispute in writing within 30 days as required by law. Any attempt to continue collection without proper validation and consideration of my documented inability to pay may constitute a violation of the FDCPA and California law.

Sincerely,
